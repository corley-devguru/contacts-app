# Setup Instructions
### Personal Technology Stack

In my development journey, I've utilized with a diverse set of frameworks and libraries. Here's a snapshot of the major technologies I've engaged with:

* #### .Net7
As a backend enthusiast, I've embraced the capabilities of .Net7 to create scalable and efficient server-side solutions. This framework has been a cornerstone in my toolkit.

* #### Angular 15
For crafting compelling user interfaces, I've delved into Angular 15. Its robust features have allowed me to build dynamic and responsive front-end experiences.

* #### Bootstrap
To ensure a seamless and visually appealing design, I've integrated Bootstrap into my projects. This CSS framework has been instrumental in creating a consistent user experience.

* #### TypeScript
In pursuit of writing more reliable and maintainable code, I've adopted TypeScript. Its static typing has significantly contributed to the quality of my codebase.

* #### Node.JS (v18.13.0)
For server-side execution of JavaScript, I've worked with Node.JS, specifically version 18.13.0. This choice aligns with my commitment to staying updated with the latest features.

* #### Angular CLI
Simplifying my Angular development workflow, I regularly use Angular CLI. This tool has been invaluable in streamlining various development tasks.

These technologies have not only shaped my technical proficiency but have also fueled my passion for creating innovative and efficient solutions.



### Backend Project Installation
To get started with the API project, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install Visual Studio

Ensure Visual Studio is installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from the official website.
#### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine using your preferred version control tool.

#### 3. Run the Application

Open the project in Visual Studio.
Build and run the application.
The Swagger page will automatically open, providing you with a comprehensive API documentation.
#### 4. Play with APIs

Explore the various APIs available on the Swagger page.
Test and interact with the endpoints to familiarize yourself with the functionality.

### Frontend Project Installation
To set up the frontend project, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install VSCode
If you don't have Visual Studio Code (VSCode) installed, download and install it from the official website.

#### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the frontend project repository to your local machine using your preferred version control tool.
#### 3. Run the Application

Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
Build and run the application.

These steps will ensure a smooth installation and setup process for both the backend and frontend projects.
   

## How to run the application
### Backend Application
1. Clone the repository
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/corley-devguru/contacts-app.git
```
2. Run the Application **ContactApp** in visual studio 2022(.NET7)
3. The Swagger page will automatically open, providing a convenient way to interact with the APIs.

### Frontend Application
1. In the same repository, navigate to the **ContactWebApp** directory.
2. Open in VSCode.
3. Ensure all the prerequisites (like Angular CLI, Node.js, VS code, etc) for running Angular applications are installed.
4. Run the application by using ng serve --open
     
   
## Application Architecture

* Clean Architecture\
Clean Architecture emphasizes separation of concerns and the independence of the business logic from external concerns like databases and frameworks. It is organized into layers, ensuring maintainability and testability of the codebase.


* CQRS pattern\
The Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern is implemented to segregate the read and write operations in the application. This ensures that the commands for changing the state of the system are separate from the queries that retrieve information.


* Repository\
The Repository pattern is employed to provide a mechanism to access data in a way that is independent of various data sources. It helps in abstracting the underlying data access details, making the system more adaptable to changes.


  
## Additional Notes

Dear HR & Engineering Team of Rethink,

I hope this message finds you well. I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to complete the assessment as part of the hiring process. It was an insightful experience, and I appreciate the chance to showcase my skills and qualifications.

Regarding the optional unit testing section, I regret to inform you that I was unable to complete it within the given timeframe. Unfortunately, I have been dealing with some family issues recently, which required my immediate attention and has impacted my schedule.

I understand the importance of the assessment process and acknowledge that completing all sections is essential. However, I want to assure you that I remain committed to the position and am more than willing to discuss any aspects of the assessment or provide additional information as needed.

I appreciate your understanding and consideration of the circumstances. Thank you for your time and the opportunity to be a part of the hiring process.

Best regards,

Stephen Corley
